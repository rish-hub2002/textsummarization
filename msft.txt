An artificially intelligent computer system makes predictions or takes actions based on patterns in existing data and can then learn from its errors to increase its accuracy. A mature AI processes new information extremely quickly and accurately, which makes it useful for complex scenarios such as self-driving cars, image recognition programmes, and virtual assistants.AI software allows users to implement general machine learning, or more specific deep learning capabilities, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.
